SYNOPSIS
--------

  */etc/ego.conf*

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The data in */etc/ego.conf* is used by *ego(8)* for configuration of kits and other settings relevant to ego commands.
The configuration file format is similar to Microsoft Windows .INI files and is parsed by the Python ConfigParser
module.

Sections are delimited with the literal format ``[SECTIONNAME]``. Currently, the following sections are supported:
*global*, *kits*. Values in each section are defined using the format ``KEY = VALUE``, one per line.

Global Section
==============

The *global* section supports the following configuration variables: *install_path*, *kits_path*, *meta_repo_path*,
*sync_user*.

**install_path**

For developers, this allows one to specify an alternate location where ego is installed. This defaults to
``/usr/share/ego``.

**kits_path**

Use this setting to specify the path to the kits directory used by meta-repo. When set to a relative path, this path
will be relative to *meta_repo_path*, but it can also be set to an absolute path, in which case it will be interpreted
as-is. The default settings for *kits_path* is "kits".

**kits_depth**

This setting specifies the default depth to use when cloning a kit. The default is 2, which is the minimum functioning
default when using LiGurOS kits directly. If using a time-delayed version of meta-repo, this can be set to a custom
value or set to 0, which will cause the kits to be cloned with complete history.

Note that in ego 2.4.0 and greater, when git-depth data is detected in meta-repo, this depth data will be used instead,
and this setting has no effect unless set to 0, which will enable full history.

**meta_repo_path**

This setting defines the directory that will house meta-repo once cloned, and also where ego and Portage will look for
meta-repo. The default value for *meta_repo_path* is ``/var/git/meta-repo``.

**repos_conf_path**

This setting specifies the directory which will be used to store generated repos.conf entries. By default, ego will
generate repos.conf configuration files (and ensure they are updated) after an ``ego sync`` operation. To differentiate
ego-generated repos.conf configuration files from user-provided files, all ego-generated files will have the prefix
``ego-``. Also note that ego will take care of cleaning up (deleting) any ``ego-`` prefixed repos.conf entries that
no longer exist in meta-repo.

**sync_user**

This setting defines the user and group that are used to perform the sync operation, and thus the user and group which
will end up owning the meta-repo files. The default value for *sync_user* is ``portage``.

**sync_base_url**

This setting defines the base URL to use for cloning of kits as well as meta-repo. Default value is
``https://github.com/funtoo/{repo}``. The ``{repo}`` value is replaced with the name of the kit or with the literal
value ``meta-repo``. Note that this setting only takes effect upon first clone, and if changed, you should remove
meta-repo and kits and perform an initial ``ego sync`` to reinitialize the repositories.


Kits Section
============

The *kits* section is used to specify non-default branches to use for LiGurOS Linux kits. By default, ``ego`` will use
the *default* kit defined by LiGurOS Linux BDFL. This information is stored in the ``metadata/kit-info.json`` in the
meta-repo directory. Users who would prefer to use alternate branches can override these selections as follows::

  [kits]

  xorg-kit = 1.19-prime
  python-kit = 3.6-prime

After changing default kit values, be sure to run ``ego sync`` to update meta-repo to point to the correct kits. Also
be sure to run ``epro update`` to regenerate your profile information (in some cases, this can be done manually by
``ego sync``).
